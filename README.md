# Sketch
Etch-a-sketch project from The Odin Project


# create a div container that will contain the grid (16x16) of divs, take a clear part of the page for that

## make the grid in JavaScript (and responsive (up to 100) later)

### Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them

#### Add a button which clears the current grid and sends user a popup asking for the number of squares for the new grid

# OPTIONAL: Instead of just changing the color of a square from one color to another, have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value
